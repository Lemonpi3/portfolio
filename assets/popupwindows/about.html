           Hi! I’m Agustín, a Product Owner and Data Scientist at JP Morgan, working in the Legal Knowledge Management space. I focus on applying Natural Language Processing,
            Search Systems, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to help teams find what they need—faster and smarter.
        </p>
        <p>My work bridges product thinking with hands-on data science. I’ve built hybrid search engines combining semantic and keyword methods,
             automated reporting pipelines, and cleaned messy datasets from platforms like Adobe Analytics to make them usable for both machine learning and business insights.</p>
        <p>I enjoy making complex systems feel intuitive—whether it's through better search, cleaner data, or smarter recommendations.
             Outside of work, I'm always tinkering with side projects, learning new tools, or experimenting with new ways to turn raw data into something useful.</p>
